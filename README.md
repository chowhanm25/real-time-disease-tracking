## üéØ Overview

A comprehensive web-based platform that enables real-time disease outbreak tracking through user-generated data and interactive global mapping. Developed as part of Advanced Software Engineering coursework at University of Windsor.

**üöÄ Problem Solved:** Traditional disease tracking systems rely on delayed government reports and lack real-time user input, creating gaps in early outbreak detection and localized health monitoring.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Disease Reporting**: Users can submit health symptoms and diagnoses with location data
- **Interactive Global Mapping**: Dynamic world map visualization with outbreak intensity indicators
- **Localized Insights**: OpenStreetMap integration for neighborhood-level disease tracking
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive charts showing disease trends and patterns over time
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with role-based access
- **Mobile Responsive**: Bootstrap-powered responsive design for all devices
- **Real-time Notifications**: Location-based alerts for disease outbreaks in user areas
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR-compliant data handling with encryption and anonymization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.0+ Framework
- Django REST Framework for APIs
- MySQL Database
- Docker containerization

**Frontend:**
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
- Interactive Mapping Libraries

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS EC2 cloud hosting
- Docker deployment
- MySQL database management

**Development Tools:**
- Git version control
- Manual testing procedures
